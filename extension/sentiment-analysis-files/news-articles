// Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden churned through his campaign donations during the last three months of 2019, leaving the former vice president with a little less than $9 million to spend ahead of the first nominating contests of the 2020 race, new filings late Friday show. || Democratic

// Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of Biden's leading rivals for the Democratic nomination, entered January with double the cash available: $18.2 million, according to reports Sanders' campaigns filed Friday night with the Federal Election Commission. || Democratic

// Another contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, had $13.7 million remaining in her campaign account at the start of the new year, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg had $14.5 million banked. || Democratic

// Biden's late-night filing showed his year-end fundraising had picked up during the final months of the year after a summer slump. He raised $23.2 million during the last fundraising quarter, but he spent virtually all of it. || Democratic

// The news comes just days before Monday's first-in-the-nation caucuses in Iowa, a state Biden has barnstormed this week in the hopes of a strong result that could boost donor enthusiasm and fuel his momentum through the early contests. || Democratic

// Biden and Sanders are at the front of the field for the Democratic national primary, a new CNN Poll of Polls shows. But Biden -- unlike Sanders and Warren -- does not have a vast base of small-dollar donors to fuel his campaign. || Democratic

// Biden received just 38% of his fourth-quarter donations in amounts of $200 or less, the new filings show. By contrast, more than half of Sanders' money came in small amounts, giving him access to supporters who can donate repeatedly before hitting contribution limits. || Democratic

// One sign of financial strain in Biden's camp emerged in recent weeks as it canceled some of the advertising he had planned in New Hampshire and South Carolina and shifted the money to Iowa. || Democratic

// A super PAC run by his allies, called Unite the Country, has scrambled to boost Biden's prospects in the Hawkeye State, running about $4.8 million in ads, according to Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. || Democratic

// New campaign finance reports show the group raised nearly $3.8 million in 2019, with about one-quarter of its haul, $1 million, coming from a single individual: George Marcus, a real estate billionaire from Palo Alto, California. Other donors included Roger Altman, a former Clinton administration official and founder of investment bank Evercore; and Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina lawyer and Biden loyalist. || Democratic

// The Senate on Friday voted to block any witnesses from being called in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, a move that marked the beginning of the end of the third Senate trial for a president in US history. || Democratic

// Senate leaders struck an agreement to hold the final vote to acquit Trump on the two articles of impeachment at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, following a debate throughout the day on Friday about how to bring the trial to a close. The impeachment trial will resume on Monday. || Democratic

// The Senate approved a resolution Friday evening from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laying out the final steps for the trial. The resolution includes closing arguments of two hours each for the House managers and the President's legal team starting at 11 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday's final vote -- and the ability for senators to deliver their own speeches explaining their votes in between. || Democratic

// Republicans defeated four Democratic amendments to McConnell's resolution on Friday evening before breaking for the weekend -- a schedule that would allow senators who are Democratic presidential candidates to travel to Iowa this weekend ahead of Monday's Iowa caucuses. || Democratic

// Republican senators said the Kentucky Republican had no choice but to cut the deal for the Wednesday acquittal vote because Democrats could have used their power under the rules to drag out the process past Tuesday's State of the Union. And Democrats had no desire to let Trump be cleared by the time of his address as the White House wanted, according to senators from both parties. || Democratic

// The Senate vote Friday to allow subpoenas for witnesses and documents failed 49-51, with two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah, joining Democrats to back extending the trial. || Democratic

// The Senate went into an extended break after the debate on the witness vote concluded but before the vote, while McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer huddled on the floor while their staffs hammer out the details on the trial endgame. || Democratic

// Democrats had hoped to entice more other Senate Republicans to join them to hear from witnesses -- especially in the wake of revelations from the draft book manuscript of former national security adviser John Bolton -- but one by one the Senate Republicans said they were ready to end the trial. || Democratic

// Their reasons differed. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said in a statement: "I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed." || Democratic

// Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, meanwhile, said the House managers had proven their case that Trump withheld US aid while pushing for an investigation into his political rivals. "The question is whether you apply capital punishment to every offense. And I think in this case, I think the answer is no, let the people make that decision," Alexander said Friday. || Democratic

// When the final vote does occur to acquit the President, it will mark the end of a remarkable, whirlwind four-month impeachment that began when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry on September 24, leading to the President's impeachment on two articles -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- less than three months later. || Democratic

// After a month delay, the Senate trial began less than two weeks ago. The House managers, led by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, presented a detailed case arguing they had overwhelming evidence that Trump withheld $400 million in US security aid and a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while he pressured Kiev to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. || Democratic

// "If the Senate allows President Trump's obstruction to stand, it effectively nullifies the impeachment power," Schiff said Friday. "It will allow future presidents to decide whether they want their misconduct to be investigated or not, whether they would like to participate in an impeachment investigation or not." || Democratic

// "The problem with the case, the problem with their position, is even with all of those witnesses, it doesn't prove up an impeachable offense. The articles fail," the President's personal attorney Jay Sekulow said. "They got the wish of the impeachment by Christmas, and that is goal. But now they want you to do the work they failed to do." || Democratic

// Collins and the other Republican moderates included a provision in the Senate trial rules to allow for Friday's witness vote, but the odds looked long for Democrats to convert four Republicans to back the vote until Sunday — when The New York Times reported Bolton's draft book manuscript alleged that Trump told him the US security aid was conditioned on investigations into Democrats, including Joe Biden. || Democratic

// On Friday, new allegations came from The Times from Bolton's manuscript — that Trump directed Bolton to help his attorney Rudy Giuliani get in touch with the Ukrainian president in May — which Schiff cited during Friday's witness debate. || Democratic

// McConnell, however, held his conference together enough to keep the witness vote at bay, with Alexander the linchpin of his bend-but-not break strategy. Until Thursday, Alexander did not tip his hand on which way he was leaning, declining to speak to reporters about it and staying quiet in GOP conference meetings. He finally asked two questions at the tail end of the two-day Senate question period in the trial, which hinted at his eventual position to oppose witnesses. || Democratic

// Shortly before Alexander's statement, Collins became the first Republican to back witnesses. "I believe hearing from certain witnesses would give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity," Collins said. || Democratic

// Romney joined her in crossing the aisle for Friday's vote, but that left Democrats two short of what they needed to call witnesses. || Democratic

// "It has also become clear some of my colleagues intend to further politicize this process, and drag the Supreme Court into the fray, while attacking the Chief Justice," Murkowski said. "I will not stand for nor support that effort. We have already degraded this institution for partisan political benefit, and I will not enable those who wish to pull down another." || Democratic

// On the Democratic side, there are still a couple of undecided senators on the vote for conviction, including Sens. Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Jones said Friday he was "pretty close" to a decision, while Manchin said he hasn't yet made one. || Democratic

// Trump critics have warned that he would be emboldened if he were acquitted by the Senate. In the hours before Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander announced he would vote against calling witnesses, likely ensuring a quick acquittal, it was at least clear that Trump was not at all chastened. || Democratic

// On Thursday, the President did a Fox News interview, delivered a speech in Michigan nominally about the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and held a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa. He was dishonest in all three venues, repeating some of his favorite falsehoods in rapid succession. || Democratic

// Trump told Fox News' Peter Doocy of impeachment: "It's a ridiculous, horrible partisan, situation. We won 196 to nothing in the House." At the event in Michigan, he said, "We won 196 to nothing on a little vote a couple of weeks ago." || Democratic

// Trump was referring to House impeachment votes he lost -- but where 196 or more Republicans voted in his favor, with none against. He lost an October vote to set the rules of the impeachment inquiry 232-196, then the December votes on the two articles of impeachment, 230-197 and 229-198. || Democratic

// Trump said in Michigan: "In fact, I was honored, believe it or not. About 10 years ago, I came to Michigan. I was honored by a wonderful group. I was the 'Man of the Year.'"<br /><br />There is no evidence Trump ever got a Man of the Year award in Michigan. You can read a full fact check here. ||Democratic

// Trump claimed in Michigan and at the Iowa rally to have eliminated the estate tax, saying at the rally of his 2017 tax law: "Because of that, there is no death tax or inheritance tax."<br /><br />The law doubled the amount of estate value that is exempt from the estate tax, but the law did not eliminate the tax entirely. And there is no basis for his suggestion at both events that small farmers and small businesspeople would especially benefit from his changes; few paid the tax even before. You can read a full fact check here. || Democratic

// Trump claimed in Michigan that real median household income had increased by "$10,000" during his presidency.<br /><br />Trump was taking a private firm's estimate of about $5,000 in pre-tax household income gains and doubling it for reasons that do not make sense. You can read a full fact check here. || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally: "I took care of the vets. We got Choice." He added that people had unsuccessfully tried to get this veterans health care program approved "for 52 years," claiming: "What I am good at is getting things approved, and I got it approved."<br /><br />Trump did not get the Veterans Choice program passed, nor had there been an unsuccessful 52-year effort to get it passed. The program was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA MISSION Act, which expanded and changed the Choice program. || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally that, under a deal with South Korea about sharing the cost of the US troops in the country, "They gave us $500 million a year more."<br /><br />As the New York Times reported in February when debunking an earlier version of Trump's "$500 million" claim: "Under the one-year deal, this year South Korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million." || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally: "USMCA: the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. OK, it is."<br /><br />Except that it's not. The Trans-Pacific Partnership included all three of the countries in the USMCA -- the US, Mexico and Canada -- plus nine others. Also, it's worth noting that the USMCA mostly makes incremental tweaks to the previous North American Free Trade Agreement. You can read a full fact check here. || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally: "We've ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on Earth, by far."<br /><br />The US has not just "now" become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a "war" on the industry. || Democratic

// Trump said of Mexico at the Iowa rally: "They put up 27,000 soldiers on our southern border."<br /><br />Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2 that the Mexican government had reported the following: "Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints. ... At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints." You can read a full fact check here. || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally: "We got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed Obamacare."<br /><br />The individual mandate, which required Americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of Obamacare -- but Trump hasn't killed Obamacare, essentially or otherwise. He has not eliminated Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally: "We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and we always will the Republican Party."<br /><br />The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. || Democratic

// Trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term; Jimmy Carter had appointed 197 judges by late January of his fourth year in office, according to data from Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments. Wheeler said Trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods -- two Supreme Court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges -- but that it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding Trump's three appointments to the Court of Federal Claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge. || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally: "Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years."<br /><br />This was one of Trump's trademark little exaggerations of accomplishments that need no exaggeration. The decline in overdose deaths in 2018 was the first since 1990, 28 years prior. || Democratic

// Trump said at the Iowa rally of the Electoral College margin in the 2016 election: "We got 306 to 223."<br /><br />Hillary Clinton earned 232, not 223, electoral votes to Trump's 306. This was not a one-time slip; Trump habitually says "223." || Democratic

// Aside from Trump's dubious characterization of the result as an Electoral College "landslide" -- the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections, the New York Times has noted -- it's not true that people haven't seen such a margin of victory "in a long time." Obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections. || Democratic

// Even prominent Democrats who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump regularly suggests. || Democratic

// The Democratic National Committee on Friday unveiled new criteria for candidates to qualify for the Feb. 19 presidential nomination debate in Nevada -- including a big change likely to pave the way for former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg to make the stage for the first time. || Republican

// The move by the DNC was quickly criticized by a number of Bloomberg’s rivals for the nomination, among them Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. || Republican

// The DNC’s action comes as Bloomberg’s seen his national poll numbers rise in recent weeks – as the multibillionaire business and media mogul’s campaigned across the country and spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to blanket the TV airwaves from coast to coast with commercials. || Republican

// And the move comes two months after Bloomberg contributed more than $300,000 to the DNC. Federal Election Commission records indicate that Bloomberg made three separate donations of $106,500 to the national party committee on Nov. 19, five days before he declared his candidacy for president. || Republican

// Asked about those contributions, Bloomberg campaign spokesperson Julie Wood told Fox News: "Mike has been a longtime donor to progressive causes and has been giving to the DNC, state parties and candidates up and down the ballot ever since Trump won the election. The only way Democrats will defeat Trump in November is with a strong Democratic party, and Mike is proud to have contributed to the party." || Republican

// The DNC has three accounts – one for the presidential election, another for election recounts and other legal proceedings, and third for the national party headquarters building in the nation’s capital. Individuals, according to FEC contribution guidelines, can contribute a maximum of $106,500 to each party account – which is what Bloomberg appeared to do. || Republican

// All of the debates in the first eight rounds -- including the upcoming Feb. 7 debate in New Hampshire -- have included both polling and individual donor thresholds for the candidates to reach to qualify for the primetime showdowns. || Republican

// But starting with the Nevada debate, which will be held in Las Vegas three days before the state's caucuses, the DNC is dropping the individual contributor requirements. That could allow Bloomberg to finally qualify. The candidate has avoided fundraising and seeking out individual donors as he self-funds his White House bid. || Republican

// “We are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together,” Bloomberg’s campaign manager, Kevin Skeekey, said. || Republican

// To make the stage in Las Vegas, candidates will need to reach 10 percent support in four national polls or surveys in Nevada and South Carolina, which holds its primary a week after Nevada and is the final of the four early states to hold a contest. Alternatively, the White House hopefuls can qualify by reaching 12 percent in two polls conducted in Nevada or South Carolina. The polls must be released between Jan. 15 and Feb. 18, the day before the Nevada debate. || Republican

// The showdown in Las Vegas takes place after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary -- and any candidate who earns at least one delegate from either of those contests to the party’s national presidential nominating convention in July in Milwaukee will also qualify for the Nevada showdown. || Republican

// Fox News’ Alex Rego, Tara Prindiville, Andrew Craft, Allie Raffa, Andres del Agiula and Rob DiRienzo highlight that the DNC's change to the debate criteria were quickly criticized by a number Bloomberg’s rivals. || Republican

// “To now change the rules in the middle of the game to accommodate Mike Bloomberg, who is trying to buy his way into the Democratic nomination, is wrong. That’s the definition of a rigged system,” senior Bernie Sanders campaign adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement soon after the news of the DNC’s move broke. || Republican

// During his 2016 run for the Democratic nomination, Sanders and supporters heavily criticized the DNC for a lack of debates. After months of protests, Sanders and his rival -- eventual nominee Hillary Clinton -- agreed with the DNC to add more debates later in the primary calendar. || Republican

// "The DNC didn’t change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. They shouldn’t change the rules to let a billionaire on. Billionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules — on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government," she tweeted. || Republican

// And tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang's presidential campaign also took aim at the DNC. “It's a mistake for @TheDemocrats to change the rules for debates in the middle of this race to yield to a billionaire. We need to respect the grassroots movement leading this party forward,” Yang campaign communications director SY Lee wrote on Twitter. || Republican

// Bloomberg, due to his late entry into the race, is not competing in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, and instead is concentrating his campaign in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states and beyond. || Republican

// “I will leave it up to the DNC to set the rules and we will compete under them. When the initial rules came out it was focused on grassroots fundraising. Sounds like there is a different focus,” Buttigieg told reporters. || Republican

// "Now that the grassroots support is actually captured in real voting, the criteria will no longer require a donor threshold," the DNC's Adrienne Watson told Fox News. "The donor threshold was appropriate for the opening stages of the race, when candidates were building their organizations and there were no metrics available outside of polling to distinguish those making progress from those who weren’t.” || Republican

// Fox News’ Prindiville spotlights that new FEC data shows that Warren’s presidential campaign spent more than $33 million in the final three months of 2019. But that’s $12 million more than the $21.2 million the senator brought in during the fourth quarter of fundraising. || Republican

// The super PAC "Unite the County" – which is supporting former Vice President Joe Biden’s White House bid  – on Friday announced that it hauled in $7.6 million from its formation on Oct. 29 through the end of 2019. || Republican

// Biden struggled with fundraising since jumping into the White House race last April. And as Raffa pointed out, the former vice president's filing Friday with the FEC indicated that he spent - $23.3 million - as much as he raised in the final three months of 2019. And his cash on hand as of Dec. 31 - which stood at $8.9 million - trailed Warren, Buttigieg, and Sanders. || Republican

// “We’re trying to level the playing field,” Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend and adviser, Democratic consultant and one of the co-founders of the super PAC, told Fox News. “We’re trying to make sure Biden’s message and record are being delivered.” || Republican

// Republicans in the Senate secured enough votes Friday evening to reject Democratic efforts to extend the impeachment trial of President Trump and call new witnesses, paving the way for his widely expected acquittal next week on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his dealings with Ukraine. || Republican

// Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said late Friday he expects to "conclude the trial in the coming days" as the Senate approved the framework to continue the trial on Monday, with a final up-or-down vote on Wednesday. || Republican

// After hours of debate during the day on Friday, the Senate voted 51-49 to block a Democratic motion to call new witnesses. The vote came after vehement demands from Democrats to call former national security adviser John Bolton to testify about the Trump-Ukraine saga. Two Republicans -- Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Maine Sen. Susan Collins -- voted with Democrats. || Republican

// "A majority of the U.S. Senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28,000-plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the House Managers’ accusations and end this impeachment trial," McConnell said after the vote. || Republican

// "America will remember this day, unfortunately, where the Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, where the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial," said Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. || Republican

// Later on Friday evening, Senate Republicans voted down four amendments offered by Democrats to call Bolton and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others. Chief Justice Roberts told Schumer before that vote series that he would not break ties in the Senate, after Democrats in recent days raised the possibility Roberts could possibly tip the scales for them during votes on amendments. || Republican

// "I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed," Roberts told Schumer. || Republican

// The vote on witnesses came as Trump was flying to Florida. A senior administration official aboard Air Force One said that the reaction to the Senate vote was “calm, but pleased." || Republican

// There will be no trial action over the weekend. The trial will resume Monday with closing arguments by the impeachment managers and defense counsel. Senators will have the opportunity to make speeches on Monday and Tuesday. || Republican

// The final vote will come the same week as Iowa’s caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address on Tuesday. A senior congressional source told Fox News that there has been no discussion about postponing the speech, as advance teams have been crawling all over the Capitol in preparation for Tuesday’s address. || Republican

// Earlier Friday, it became apparent that Republicans had the votes to shut down any new witnesses from testifying in the trial, with Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, announcing they wouldn’t defect. || Republican

// After the vote on witnesses, Trump drew attention to the number of witnesses during the House's impeachment proceedings: "Democrats = 17 Witnesses. Republicans = 0 Witnesses." || Republican

// On Friday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., rejected criticism that Democrats are trying to extend the trial until after the Iowa caucuses, which would keep four 2020 White House hopefuls away from the campaign trail and past Trump’s planned State of the Union address on Tuesday. || Republican

// Earlier in the day, several GOP senators grumbled at the prospect of the trial continuing past Friday. Many expressed frustration that Trump got impeached on what they believe is a flimsy case and they want the trial to end as soon as possible. || Republican

// As the highly polarized impeachment trial of President Trump rages on in the Senate, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg panned the "dysfunction" and "polarization" at an award ceremony in Washingon. || Republican

// Though she did not mention impeachment specifically, Ginsburg spoke about the lack of cooperation between the two parties in recent years and reflected on how the collaboration between Republicans and Democrats was much more common when she was confirmed onto the Supreme Court. || Republican

// "Now we've seen the high degree of polarization in recent years," Ginsburg said at a LBJ Foundation event Thursday. "Yes, that's true… My hope is that someday there will be patriots on both sides of the aisle who are determined to stop the dysfunction we are now experiencing and will decide that their institutional government should work for the benefit of all of the people." || Republican

// When asked what her fears for the U.S. over the next decade were, she continued: "That is the fear that this polarization will continue, and my greatest hope is that it will end. So you think back to how it was in '93, the person who was my biggest supporter on the Senate Judiciary Committee was not the then-chairman, although the chairman was certainly in my corner; it was then-Senator Biden. But my greatest supporter was Orrin Hatch of Utah. And, Strom Thurmond gave me a supply of Strom Thurmond key chains, which has lasted until last year." || Republican

// Ginsburg's comments came on the same day that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. seemingly undermined her colleague Chief Justice John Roberts in a question she submitted for him to read during the impeachment trial. || Republican

// "At a time when large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution?" Roberts read from the card handed to him by the clerk before shooting a visibly irritated look in what appeared to be Warren's direction. || Republican

// "It is the most collegial place I have ever worked. One symbol of it is every day before we sit to hear cases, and every day before we confer on cases, we go around the conference room, each justice shakes hands with every other," she said. "And that's the way of saying ‘Yes, you circulated a pretty spicy dissent yesterday' ... but we're all in this together and we know that the institution we serve is ever so much more important than our individual egos. So to make it work, we have to not just tolerate but genuinely appreciate each other." || Republican

// Ginsburg has made similar comments in the past. Last year, for example, she defended the two most junior justices of the Supreme Court, Trump-appointees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, at a forum hosted by Duke Law School. || Republican

// At an hourlong question-and-answer session, Duke Law professor Neil Siegel lamented that "nominees for the Supreme Court are not chosen primarily anymore for independence, legal ability, personal decency, and I wonder if that’s a loss for all of us." || Republican

// Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raised more than $1 million in January for her re-election campaign, making it her best fundraising month ever, according to her campaign. The progressive firebrand crushed her monthly goal after Fox News reported Jan. 10 Ocasio-Cortez refused to pay her $250,000 in “dues” to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, upsetting her liberal colleagues who bashed her for trying to undermine their party. || Republican

// Ocasio-Cortez owned her decision to refuse paying dues to the DCCC, bashing its policy to “blacklist” venders that help progressive primary challengers. She pledged to continue to support primary challengers to certain incumbents, a move that has angered her fellow Democratic members of Congress. || Republican

// The New York Democrat also posted impressive 2019 numbers on Friday. Ocasio-Cortez ended the year raising $5.5 million, including $1.98 million just in the final quarter. She ends the year with $2.9 million in cash on hand, new campaign finance records posted with the Federal Election Commission show. || Republican

// Those transfer donations include checks from high-dollar backers like George Soros, Alexander Soros, Pat Stryker, Steven Spielberg, Kate Spielberg, Larry Silverstein, Jill Glazer and Peter Chernin. || Republican
